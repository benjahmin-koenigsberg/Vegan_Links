            "We live in a world of animal lovers, nobody or at least virtually nobody would say they don’t like animals. Practically everyone agrees that animal cruelty is wrong and those that commit animal cruelty should be punished. This is why we have laws in place protecting the rights of animals, or at least certain animals. But how can a world of animal lovers be the same world that also believes that the deaths of over 56 billion land animals and as many as 2.7 trillion marine animals a year is not only acceptable but actively support its continuance, believing it is morally justifiable? So can you love animals and eat them? The answer is no, of course you can’t, because the two ideas juxtapose one another. Saying you love animals whilst eating their bodies and secretions is like saying “of course I can love my child and beat them”. If an abusive parent said that they loved their child but were also beating them we would think they were a psychopath. This demonstrates the disturbing psychology and paradoxical ideology we have as a collective society of ‘animal lovers’ who are in fact animal eaters. To put this another way, if you love someone the last thing you want to happen to them is for them to be forcibly impregnated, tortured, murdered and eaten, let alone pay for these things to happen to them. If you love someone then you want to avoid bad things happening to them at all costs, so if you love animals then by default the last thing you would ever want is to see their murdered body parts on a plate in front of you. This can even be put in simpler terms. If you are talking to an animal eater and they have a companion animal like a dog, ask them if it would be possible to love their dog if they mutilated and murdered him/her. To be a lover of animals is to love, respect and show compassion to them, all of them, not just the ones society tells you to love. To truly be an animal lover, you have to acknowledge that all animals are worthy of life and deserve to live that life free from human oppression. So no, the excuse you can love animals and eat them is not a valid justification for someone to eat animals, in fact it’s not even possible. When a non-vegan claims to be an animal lover, explain their hypocrisy to them, simply say “can you really be an animal lover if you pay for animals to be hurt?” - chances are they’ve never thought about their relationship with animals in this way before.",

        description:
            "“Respect my opinion!”, “It's my personal choice to eat meat, don't force your views on to me!” - of all the excuses used to defend eating animal products, this could well be the most common. So is eating animals a personal choice or is it a little more complex than that? This is quite an interesting excuse as arguably it is a choice, one does actively choose to eat dead flesh and animal secretions, the same way that a racist actively chooses to be racist or a rapist actively chooses to commit rape. Using this logic it would then be morally justifiable to beat a dog or kick a cat, as it is a personal choice to do so. In this situation ask the person, “if someone makes the personal choice to abuse a dog, does that make it morally justifiable?”. The problem is when non-vegans use this argument they have either become so detached from the fact that their animal products came from a living being, or they hold animals with such little regard that they don't consider the lives of their food worthy of contemplation because they think the consumption of animal products only affects them as individuals. So when a vegan seeks to educate a non-vegan we are met with “you should respect other people's points of view”. However, as vegans we do respect the views of others. We respect the views of the 56 billion land animals murdered each year that didn't want to die. We respect the views of the dairy cows and egg-laying hens whose bodies are sexually abused and exploited and treated as nothing other than a disposable commodity. We respect the views of the 2 - 2.7 trillion fish and marine animals that are dragged out of their natural habitat every year and suffocated or crushed to death. We respect the views of animals skinned alive for their fur or abused, tortured and killed for their skin, wool and feathers. We respect the views of the animals callously tested on by scientists and cosmetics companies, confined to a life of agony and unbelievable pain. We respect the views of the animals beaten and punished to perform circus tricks and unnatural behaviours for our entertainment. We respect the views of every animal that is oppressed, tortured and murdered. We respect the views of the humans who are also victims within our systems of animal exploitation - and we even respect the view of the person we are talking to, the view that they probably want to live a long life by caring enough to tell them that consuming animal products hugely increases their risk of cancer, diabetes, strokes, dementia, heart disease and every other major disease plaguing our species. So when people so defiantly tell us to respect the views of others, the question is, which other view point are they considering other than their own? When they declare it's their personal choice to eat animal products, what about the personal choice of every other creature, human and non-human alike, whose life is treated as inferior and meaningless just so people can poison their bodies with products created from their death and fear? It is not morally justifiable to murder just because the murderer personally made the choice to murder. It is not morally justifiable to rape just because the rapist personally made the choice to commit the act of rape. It is not morally justifiable to kick and beat a dog just because the abuser personally made the choice to kick and beat the dog and it is not morally justifiable to pay for animals to be exploited and killed, just because a non-vegan personally made the choice to pay for animals to be exploited and killed. When someone uses the “my personal choice” argument, simply ask them “what about the personal choice of the animal who wants to live, have you considered their choice?”.",

        description:
            "When it boils down to it, the number one reason people eat animal products is because they enjoy the taste - I know I certainly did, in fact like most people I loved the taste of animal products. I think one of the most disconcerting things about the taste excuse though, is that it is an excuse that bluntly admits that the personal desires of an individual’s taste preference matter more than the morality surrounding an animal’s life and unquestionably horrific death. However, it doesn’t mean that the person using this excuse necessarily believes that their taste preferences are more important than an animal’s life (most people I talk to don’t) but because they’ve never been asked about it before they’ve never had to confront the fact that through their actions they are placing their taste higher. This is why when people say to me “I love the taste of meat.” or, “I could never give up cheese.”, I like to ask them “do you value your taste buds higher than the life of an animal?” - most people will say no, but if they do say yes make sure to ask them why. One of the big issues with this excuse is that it seeks to validate a non-vegan diet by claiming that we shouldn’t be held responsible for our immoral activities because our selfish impulses are too strong to be suppressed and as such, we can’t be held morally accountable for the actions that we make. But where do we draw the line? Would this argument hold up in court if a murderer in their own defence said, “but I could never give up murdering because I enjoy it too much.”? It requires more than sensory pleasure to morally justify something - and the inconvenience people go through by giving up cheese, for example, is not even remotely comparable to the pain a dairy cow goes through being forcibly impregnated repeatedly, having her children taken away from her and being painfully pumped for her milk before she becomes too weak and is sent off to be slaughtered. I think one of the reasons why as vegans we find this excuse a really difficult one to hear is because it doesn’t matter whatever product people claim they could never give up or enjoy the taste of, the difficulty and the inconvenience that it would be for them to no longer eat animal products is minuscule compared to the pain, suffering and fear that the animals have to go through. A non-vegan meal lasts for 15 minutes, but the death of an animal is eternal. What food could ever be worth taking the life of an individual? An individual that felt fear, an individual that felt pain, an individual that felt confused and couldn’t understand why such intolerable suffering was being committed against them? The fear of death is not unique to humans. Most of us fear dying and hope it will happen peacefully, surrounded by the ones we love without pain. The scariest thing we can think of is being tortured and ultimately murdered. We make horror films about this concept and it gives us nightmares. But this isn’t a horror film for the trillions of animals that are slaughtered each year, it isn’t some nightmare that they will wake from. It’s real, the pain, the fear, it is all real - and then they die and they are gone forever. We need only put ourselves in the position of the animals, as they look up at the human who’s about to murder them and imagine their fear and confusion, to understand why taste can never justify this incomprehensible atrocity. When talking to someone who uses the excuse of taste, ask them the following questions: “Do you not think we require more than sensory pleasure alone to morally justify an action?. “Is it morally justifiable for someone to kill a dog if they like the taste?” “What is it about being human that means the life of an animal is lower than our taste preferences?” “Do you think it is acceptable to inflict pain, suffering and death on to an animal that wishes to avoid pain, suffering and death?” “If we would hate to be exploited and killed, is it not hypocritical for us to exploit and kill others?” Also, remember to explain that it’s not as if people even have to give up the flavours of the animal products that they eat. There is now such a huge and varied selection of vegan alternatives to cheese, milk, eggs and meats. Explain that as vegans we eat burgers, hot dogs, burritos, nachos, lasagna, mac and cheese, curries, cheese pizza, cakes, cupcakes, cheesecakes, cookies, ice cream and everything else in between. Explain how as vegans we experience all of the flavours and textures that we used to, except now they’re made from plants. No dead body parts, no gristle, no cholesterol, no hormones, no antibiotics. It’s also really helpful to tell them where they can get these products from, so for example here in the UK, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have their own range of vegan cheese and you can get meat alternatives in nearly every supermarket. I also think it can be worth highlighting which restaurants now have vegan menus and options, again just to make veganism seem as easy and accessible as possible. Some great examples of places in the UK are: Wagamama, Zizzi, Pizza Express, Nando’s, Pizza Hut, GBK, Wetherspoons, Pret A Manger, All Bar One and Carluccio’s.",

            "When confronted with the idea that the consumption of animals is done purely for the taste rather than for nutrition (see nutrition) one of the most common excuses vegans hear is, “but animals eat other animals, so why shouldn’t we?” As much as this may be true, some animals do indeed eat other animals, there’s many reasons as to why this statement holds no veracity whatsoever. We need only first consider the anatomical biology of omnivores compared to that of humans. Firstly, omnivores have sharp claws and huge fangs compared to our hands and blunt, ineffective canines. When was the last time you saw a human running on all fours ripping the flesh off a living animal? Omnivores also have short intestines, ideal for digesting flesh, whilst humans have incredibly long intestines, which are useless at digesting flesh - hence the constipation and colon cancer! The acid contained within omnivore and carnivore stomachs is very strong hydrochloric acid, ideal for the digestion of raw animal flesh, which when compared to the weak acid found in our stomachs, explains why we are susceptible to food poisoning from undercooked meat. You don’t see a lion checking to make sure their dinner is cooked through all the way to the middle. You also don’t see a lion being picky about which part of an animal they should eat, but how often do we see stories in the newspaper of the shocking revelation that a brain was found in a piece of KFC? It’s like for that split second the illusion that meat doesn’t come from a living, breathing, feeling animal is shattered and people are forced to confront the abject reality of where their food comes from. A real omnivore isn’t disgusted by the gore. Let’s consider this, if you were locked in a room with a live chicken and an apple you would always eat the apple first. Because when we see a living being we don’t feel hungry, we don’t want to ravage animals and tear them apart - but when we see an apple we do feel hungry. Furthermore, even though certain animals eat other animals, there are many more herbivorous animals than there are carnivorous ones. But regardless, what exactly is the relevance of what other animals do when applied to human behaviour? Some animals rape and kill each other, so does that mean humans would be excused if they committed these acts too? Ask that question to the non-vegan who is using the excuse, say “wild animals kill each other, does that mean it is morally justifiable for humans to kill each other just because some wild animals do?”. Furthermore, lions have been documented killing their own cubs before, so using non-vegan logic it must therefore be acceptable for humans to kill their children as other animals have been shown to do so. In this situation ask the non-vegan “do you think it is wise to base our morality on that of a wild animal?”. Animals also kill their food themselves, they don’t pay others to kill on their behalf because they find the prospect of slaughtering an animal too traumatising. If we were naturally designed to eat meat we would have no objection to killing animals. We also wouldn’t shelter the truth from our children and yet we deem the reality of slaughterhouses to be too troubling and disturbing for a child. Other animals kill out of necessity whereas humans do not, in fact eating animals is incredibly detrimental to our health. Humans kill other animals because we enjoy the way they taste, meaning we kill them for pleasure, even though this goes against many of our core morals. Many of us oppose animal exploitation when it comes to things like dog fighting or hunting as they are seen as unnecessary and only done for pleasure and yet can’t see that eating animals is also unnecessary and only done for pleasure. It’s important to try and get people to make this connection so you can also ask the non-vegan “are you an obligate carnivore?” and then say “if you don’t have to eat meat then why do you do so?”. If they say it’s because they like the taste, then ask “are your tastebuds more important than a life?”. As you can see, the circle of excuses tends to go round like a revolving door! It is so unbelievably ironic that we deem ourselves so incredibly superior to animals (see intelligence), but when the superiority argument no longer functions as an effective excuse for murdering living beings, we suddenly portray ourselves as just a wild animal acting out our primal instincts. So what are we, better than animals, or only animals? We can’t be both.",

            "Hearing that we need to eat animal products in order to be healthy is a very frustrating excuse for a vegan to hear, after all, we’re living evidence that this simply isn’t true. However the majority of people truly believe that animal products contain nutritional elements that we cannot get elsewhere and that we need for our health and longevity, after all, there has to be a real reason why we’re doing all of these horrific things to animals, right? The main nutritional factors that come up in conversations with non-vegans are protein, iron, calcium and if they’re a bit more clued up, B12. I would strongly recommend watching and memorising the points in these four videos by Bite Size Vegan and M.D Michael Greger. 1) Protein: Dr Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org 2) Iron: Dr. Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org 3) Calcium: Dr. Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org 4) B12: Dr. Michael Greger of nutritionfacts.org You can quite easily shut a non-vegan down in an argument about nutrition by explaining to them that The American Dietetic Association and the British Dietetic Association, the largest bodies of nutrition and diet professionals in both countries, have both stated that a plant-based (vegan) diet is nutritionally adequate and safe for all stages of life, including pregnancy. Meaning that we can officially get all the nutrients we need without eating animals or their secretions. Protein, iron, calcium and every other nutrient that we associate with animal products can be obtained easily without the need for exploiting animals. The largest and strongest land animals in the world, the elephant, the rhino, the hippopotamus, what do they all have in common? They are all plant eaters. But does anyone think an elephant is protein deficient, or that a rhino has weak bones? What about a gorilla, humans share approximately 98% of our DNA with gorillas and they are herbivorous. But how many protein deficient gorillas do we see? Why would animals that have almost the same DNA as us but that are also much stronger than we are, be able to get all the nutrients they need from plants, if we humans can’t? In fact, consuming animal products has been linked to our top diseases and illnesses. Heart disease, type-2 diabetes, many forms of cancer, strokes, hypertension, dementia and osteoporosis have all been inextricably linked to the consumption of animal products and many of them can be treated and even reversed by switching to a plant- based lifestyle. Recommend that the non-vegan watches ‘Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death’ (YouTube) and ‘What the Health’ (Netflix). There are an abundance of plant-based athletes across the world including Germany’s strongest man Patrick Baboumian, NFL players such as David Carter and weightlifters such as Kendrick Farris and boxers like David Haye. You can reference these athletes in your conversation with non-vegans. Ask the non-vegan if there is any necessity for us to eat animals and their secretions, to which they cannot logically reply to with “yes” after receiving the information above about nutrition. Then say to them “does this not therefore mean that doing these things to animals is an act of unnecessary cruelty?”.",

            "It is true we have been eating animals for many centuries, but does the longevity of something justify its continuation and existence? Is the excuse, “eating animals is a tradition” a valid justification for not becoming vegan? Let’s just consider that slavery was once considered a tradition, as was treating a woman as less than a man - but does the fact that these things were once traditional justify them? I think (and hope) most of us would say no. If humanity had gone through history too stubborn and ignorant to change because of so called tradition then we would never have evolved or adapted. What about female genital mutilation? It’s been performed on women for centuries, it’s deep rooted in tradition and yet it is abhorrent. However, using the justification that eating animals is acceptable because it is traditional then means that performing female genital mutilation is therefore acceptable as well. You see, the logic here is extremely flawed as both acts are absolutely horrific and the excuse of tradition serves in no way as any kind of justification for them. To apply this argument to another scenario where non-human animals are the ones affected, bullfighting is very much considered a tradition as is the slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, but does that mean that these things should still continue? The Yulin Dog Meat Festival and the Boknal Dog Meat Festival are both annual events where thousands of dogs and cats are killed and eaten, they are both traditional events and yet throughout the western world we voice our disgust at these festivals. When people bring up tradition as a justification to eat animals, I like to ask: “The Yulin dog meat festival is traditional, does that make it okay to butcher and kill dogs and cats?”. In terms of cultural identity - why should we celebrate culture with the slaughter of innocent beings when we can honour different cultures and areas of life through music, dance and language? Why is the unifying factor that binds all of humanity together the consumption of animals and not the universal acknowledgement that we are all brothers and sisters, creatures of this earth who are united by sharing one planet? Not the same but equal. Cultural tradition cements us in our past transgressions. If humanity is to ever evolve past abusing animals, we need to erase all concepts of tradition, for tradition is the construct of ego, passed on by generations to eradicate and deter the threat of change. Tradition has never and will never be a valid excuse for the acts we have committed as a species and especially not for the continued murder and consumption of sentient life. In a situation where a non-vegan uses tradition as an excuse ask them: “Is female genital mutilation morally justifiable because it is a tradition?”. “Is the slaughter of dolphins in Japan morally justifiable because it is traditional?” “Is bullfighting morally justifiable because it’s part of culture and tradition?” “With these in mind, do you think culture and tradition are good indicators for our morality?”",

        description:
            "When discussing veganism, one of the strangest yet most commonly used moral justifications for killing animals is that our ancestors used to do it. We often hear people say “you wouldn’t be here if your ancestors didn’t eat meat”, which is not necessarily incorrect but why are we basing our morality on the actions of our ancestors, primitive beings that had no perception of modern day morality and did entirely unethical things such murder and rape without consequence? Surely if eating is animals is acceptable because cavemen did it, then raping and murdering one another today must also be morally justifiable? Ask the non-vegan you are talking to, “do you think it is wise to base our morality on the actions of our primitive ancestors?” or, “if it’s morally justifiable to eat animals because our ancestors used to do it, does that not mean that it must also be morally justifiable to murder each other, as our ancestors use to do that as well?”. If non-vegans really want to live like their ancestors then they would eat a predominantly vegan diet with the exception of some occasional insects. They would also sleep outside, not use technology, speak in primitive and underdeveloped languages, get overly excited by the creation of fire and have incestuous experiences. Another thing people will say similar to the ancestors argument is that “we’ve always eaten meat”. It is such a regressive idea to look into the past for how we should live and basing our actions purely on whether or not we’ve done something for a long period of time is certainly not a good idea, if we did that we would still have slavery and apartheid. If anyone ever brings up the argument “we’ve always done it” ask them, “there was a time when treating a woman as less than a man was all we’d ever done, would that make treating a woman as less than a man morally acceptable today?”. Tied in closely with the ancestors argument is the idea that eating meat helped us evolve into the beings that we are today and because of that it is morally justifiable to continue eating animals. It is common knowledge and widely accepted that we evolved from primates who survived on a diet comprised predominantly of fruits, nuts, leaves and the occasional insects, but our diets have changed and evolved as the environments we’ve lived in have changed and evolved. It is often cited that the reason we are so intelligent now is because we ate meat and many non-vegans claim that it helped us develop and evolve. Even if this is true, it has no relevance to our society today as our brains are not developing every time we eat a big mac, nor are we evolving as a species every time we enter Nando’s. Quite the opposite in fact. As explained in the section of this e-book on nutrition, eating animal products is a hinderance to our health, as opposed to being beneficial. Consuming foods that have a negative impact on our health can therefore not be considered helpful to the evolution of our species. Because of eating animal products, we are dying younger than we would be without them. Couple that with the fact that animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the entire transportation system combined and is the leading cause of rainforest destruction, oceanic dead zones, species extinction, top soil erosion, land desertification and a whole host of other environmental concerns, it quickly becomes apparent that the future of our evolution depends on us not eating animals. The United Nations has in fact stated that the world needs to shift to a plant- based diet in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. (http:// www.cowspiracy.com/facts/ - for all environmental facts) Furthermore, there are also other theories as to why our brains developed. The first is that we began to eat cooked starchy foods and more carbohydrate dense foods. These starches would have been readily available and with the brain using 60% of the human body’s blood glucose, such high glucose demands would not have been met on a low carbohydrate diet. Another idea is that we expanded our consciousness by consuming hallucinogenic mushrooms which allowed us to access parts of our brain previously unexplored, which therefore ultimately made us more self-aware and intelligent. Now undoubtedly eating animals helped us survive through times of food scarcity but just as the very foundations of much our society was built upon slavery doesn’t justify slavery in today’s world, the fact that eating animals helped us get to this point or helped us survive in the past, doesn’t justify eating animals in today’s world. In contemporary society we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions and in doing so we are shortening our lifespan, destroying our planet and causing an unimaginable amount of unnecessary harm to innocent, living beings.",

        description:
            "On face value this excuse can seem quite comical but actually I think it’s an excuse that can seem very valid if you don’t know the answer. This excuse is the idea that if we stopped eating animals they would all just be released and cause havoc to our environment, or they’d all be slaughtered and then just discarded. To debunk this excuse all we have to do is highlight the fact that animal agriculture works on a system of supply and demand, when we buy products we demand that more be supplied. Farmers only breed as many animals as they can sell, they’re not going to breed more because it quite simply would not be economically viable. Now because the world isn’t going to go vegan overnight and it will instead be a gradual process over a long period, this means that as more and more people go vegan, less and less animals will be bred in proportion with the rise of veganism. As the movement continues to grow this pattern will also continue which means that when we eventually end up with a vegan world, farmers simply won’t be breeding animals into production anymore. Consequently, we will never end up with a situation where billions of animals are being released into the wild or taken to the slaughterhouse to be killed and then discarded. I’ve even had non-vegans tell me that it isn’t vegan to be vegan because billions of animals would need to be slaughtered, but once we apply the supply and demand logic to this excuse it becomes easy to understand why that statement is entirely disingenuous. The conversation will often then go on to the non-vegan arguing that this will mean these animals will go extinct. This is actually quite an interesting argument as obviously the number of these animals will decline exponentially to the point of extinction. Now there’s a couple of ways of looking at this argument: firstly, the animals that we eat and exploit for food are not natural animals, they have all been domesticated, selectively bred and modified in some way that means they were never meant to exist. Dairy cows have been modified to produce up to ten times more milk than they would naturally. Egg-laying hens have been bred to produce up to 300 eggs a year rather than the 10 - 20 they would produce naturally. Broiler chickens have been bred to grow abnormally large at an incredibly quick rate and sheep have been modified to produce more wool than they would naturally and often give birth to more lambs than they would naturally. Because of these modifications it’s very unlikely that any of these animals would be able to survive on their own in the wild and as such, they would need humans to care for and look after them. Ultimately, we would really end up with a choice of whether or not we wanted to sustain healthy populations of these animals or whether we think it would be more ethical to allow them to no longer exist and instead replenish our eco-systems with their natural bio-diversity. We would also theoretically be able to reintroduce many of the natural wild animals back into their habitats as we would no longer require such huge expansive areas of land for animal agriculture. There would of course still be sanctuaries as well, where rescued animals would be allowed to live their life and there will always be an abundance of people who would be happy to put the time and money into looking after the farmed animals and giving them the care that they need. I think it’s also important to note that many of these animals are not native to the countries which they are artificially bred in to. For example, sheep are not native to America and shouldn’t be there and unfortunately, it’s the natural wildlife who are then the ones who face the consequences of this as their natural habitat is destroyed in order to make way for farming land. Native wild animals are also often hunted and killed in order to protect the farmer’s flocks. I think if someone mentions extinction, it’s important to point out that animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction - and we are in the largest mass species extinction of the past 65 million years. So if they’re concerned about species extinction, they should really go vegan!",

            'It’s funny how when you tell people that you are a vegan activist, or even just a supporter of animal rights, people all of a sudden become the most ardent humanitarians. The excuse “but shouldn’t we be concentrating on solving human issues” is then conjured up in act of defiant justification for continuing the consumption of animal products. But is this a justifiable excuse, should we fix human problems first? One of the key problems with this excuse is it can be applied to anything. If someone was to say “I think it’s really important that we deal with helping the homeless" you could say, “but shouldn’t we be worrying about fixing Syria?” or, “I think we need to address the slashing of benefits for the disabled” one could say, “but shouldn’t we be more worried about the exploitation of garment workers in Bangladesh?”. All of these issues need solving and nothing is achieved by devaluing any of them. Being vegan is as simple as not eating animal products, not wearing animal skin, not purchasing cosmetics tested on animals and not supporting animal exploitation of any kind. So you can be a humanitarian and a vegan. You can volunteer at a homeless shelter and be vegan and you can be building schools and hospitals in impoverished countries and still be a vegan. Being vegan is a passive action, it requires very little from the individual. One of the main issues with this excuse is that it really highlights the underlying belief that many people have, which is that humans are not animals and we exist as separate or superior to the animal kingdom. It is a very clear indictment of the speciesist mentality our society has. And beyond all of this, what most non-vegans don’t seem to realise is that if we all turned vegan we wouldn’t just end animal exploitation, we would end some of the most important human rights issues facing our species today. We are currently growing enough food to feed around 12 billion people and yet in a world of only 7 and a half billion, around 800 million people are living in a state of starvation due to lack of food - food that we have but that we feed to non-human animals instead so that we can eat their flesh. In fact the United States alone could feed every single one of those 800 million people with the grain that they feed to livestock animals. Furthermore, 82% of starving children live in countries where food is grown to feed livestock animals. Going vegan could end this unfair distribution of food. If we all went vegan we would end the exploitation of migrant workers and people in poverty, who work in slaughterhouses out of necessity and have some of the highest rates of suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, PTSD, depression and anxiety in any profession. If we all went vegan we would end the exploitation of tannery workers in India, Bangladesh and other third world countries where 90% of workers die before the age of 50 and have children born heavily disabled due to all the poisonous chemicals required in the production of leather. If we all went vegan we would end the exploitation of tribal groups in the Amazon, whose communities are being uprooted and destroyed so that the animal agriculture industries can destroy more of the rainforest. Going vegan allows us to become more in touch with our innate compassion, if we all went vegan society would naturally become more loving and gentle. How could we hurt another human being if as a society we felt that inflicting suffering onto a chicken was immoral? When faced with the staggering facts that show just how much human exploitation is required to produce the animal products we eat and wear, it becomes obvious that any attempt to devalue the suffering of animals with that of humans is not only disingenuous but ill-conceived. The excuse “but shouldn’t we be concentrating on human rights issues” is not justifiable because being vegan means we ARE concentrating on human issues. If we care about the suffering of humans then we should be vegan. If confronted with this excuse you could try asking: “Do you think it’s strange that we have enough food to feed 56 billion land animals every year, yet there are 800 million people currently living in a state of starvation?” Or, “How does the fact that there is war in the Middle East or people living homeless make it acceptable for you to pay someone else to kill and butcher an animal?',

            "This is an excuse that I hear a lot more often than I ever expected to. Even before I was vegan I never once considered that plants felt pain and suffered when we ate them and yet for some reason since going vegan, this something I am constantly getting told. Firstly and most obviously, it’s important to address the science behind this. A plant lacks a central nervous system, pain receptors and a brain which means that anatomically they don’t have the ability to feel pain. If we also consider that the primary reason human and non-human animals feel pain is to alert us that we are in danger or are being hurt and that we need to escape the situation that we are in, a plant cannot move and thus any pain would be inescapable, making life torturous for any plant. Which begs the question, why would plants ever evolve such a horribly debilitating and destructive characteristic, as it goes against the fundamental purpose of evolution? If we now view the “plants feel pain argument” from a creationist point of view, why would a benevolent and compassionate God give such a horrible curse to plants? Why would he allow them to suffer so terribly, if it served no purpose for their survival? I think part of where the confusion regarding plants and pain comes from is that it is true that they are alive and they conduct various activities at a cellular level, such as tilting to face the sunlight. In fact, plants are capable of doing some truly amazing things, but they do not conduct any activities at a conscious or cognitive level, in essence meaning that plants are not sentient. I think a really good way of highlighting this to people is to point out that plants react but they don’t respond. A venus fly trap shuts itself on to a fly, not because it is consciously aware that a fly has landed onto it, but because it reacts to the pressure stimuli caused when the fly lands onto it. This is why the venus flytrap will close around anything that triggers this response, including cigarettes butts. A cow on the other hand, won’t eat cigarette butts just because someone puts them in their mouth because a cow consciously responds. If we move past the science of whether or not plants feel pain and concentrate on the ethics of the excuse, I am doubtful that anyone truly believes that dropping a cauliflower into boiling water and boiling chickens alive (something that often happens in the chicken slaughtering process) is the same thing. Nobody thinks that slicing the neck of a cow is similar to cutting the stems off a broccoli, or castrating a pig is similar to peeling a potato. But say the person you are talking to is determined that plants feel pain like animals do - it takes up to 16 kilograms of plants to create 1 kilogram of animal flesh, meaning vastly more plants are killed in the production of animal products than they are vegan products. On top of this it’s important to note that up to 91% of Amazon rainforest destruction is due to animal agriculture, meaning that millions of trees have been and continue to be destroyed because of our consumption of animal products. So if the person you are speaking to truly believes that plants feel pain and are sentient, then remind them that by consuming non-vegan products they are not only causing the suffering of animals but also causing the alleged suffering of huge amounts of plants as well. To be honest, if this excuse comes up I often avoid talking about the science of whether or not plants have the ability to feel pain as sometimes people will say, “but science has only gone so far” and they get stuck with that point. Instead, I often just go straight into talking about the amount of crops killed for animal products, so perhaps try asking: “For the sake of discussion, let’s say plants do feel pain, are you aware that it can take up to 16 kilograms of plants to create 1 kilogram of animal flesh, so vastly more plants are murdered for animal products than they are vegan products?” You could also ask, “If you were driving down the road and a dog jumped out in front of your car, would you swerve onto a bed of flowers to avoid hitting the dog?” - this reinforces in people’s minds that there is morally a difference between non-human animals and plants, as in that situation we would always choose to avoid the dog and instead hit the plants.",

            "Continuing on from the excuse “plants feel pain”, I think it is also important to discuss whether or not animals feel pain, or at least do they feel pain the same as humans, as people do sometimes question this. In fact, I’ve even been told before that non-human animals don’t have brains, which is frightening to hear that people actually think that. We’ve had laws in place for a long time that require that we treat animals “humanely”, now these are quite obviously ineffective, however the point is that we do recognise that if we abuse let’s say a dog, we will be punished for doing so because we understand that the dog feels pain and has the capacity to suffer. If we draw comparisons to the plants feel pain argument, we don’t have any laws forbidding me from going out onto the street and pulling all the petals off a daisy. Another example would be the way that we slaughter animals, now obviously we all recognise that what happens in slaughterhouses is anything but humane - humane slaughter, after all, is an oxymoron. It can never exist. However, what’s important to note is that we do have methods in place that are there to supposedly reduce the suffering of the animals that we kill, the reason that this is important is because that means we acknowledge as a society that the animals we kill have the ability to feel pain and suffer. From a science perspective, non-human animals have the same or at least almost identical areas of the brain involved in processing pain and show similar pain behaviours to humans. When our companion animals are in pain they act correspondingly, showing unusual behavioural traits like rocking back and forth, emitting distress calls and changes in the rate and depth of breathing, such as panting. Humans in pain also display these behaviours. Many non-vegans think that fish don’t feel pain, however fish are scientifically proven to feel pain and have also been shown to adopt uncharacteristic behaviours in situations that provoke pain. Furthermore fish have sensory neurons that are physiologically identical to humans. In fact when morphine has been administered to fish showcasing pain, their symptoms and responses disappeared, like they do in humans. Sentient beings need to be able to feel pain in order to survive as it allows them to escape from dangerous situations and minimise potential injury. So let’s broaden the argument and encapsulate emotional pain into the excuse. We have established that animals feel physical pain but it is also well documented that they experience emotional suffering just like us humans do. Mother cows mourn the kidnapping of their babies by crying for hours, orcas as well have been shown to mourn the kidnapping of their offspring and animals such as dogs have been shown to suffer from separation anxiety when their companion human leaves them on their own. So now that we have established that animals feel both physical and emotional pain, the question becomes but do they feel pain as much as humans do? There seems to be an idea, an ignorant but nonetheless commonly accepted idea, that humans are more capable of suffering because we deem ourselves to be more intellectually sophisticated. There is however no evidence to support the argument that we suffer greater than non-human animals - and in fact it is plausible that it would be more correct to assume the opposite of this. If we compare the suffering that say a dog would go through breaking their leg, compared to the suffering a human would go through, it could be argued that a dog would suffer more because of certain cognitive differences. A human would know what the problem was and would know that it could be easily treated and that the pain will end. A dog on the other hand wouldn’t understand what had happened in the same way and would be greatly confused by the pain and wouldn’t have the same understanding that the pain will at some point end, arguably making their experience of the same event worse. But really it is entirely irrelevant the degree of pain an animal feels, it could be more than humans, it could be less. We all feel different degrees of pain but that realisation doesn’t justify inflicting unnecessary pain. You might feel less pain than I do but it wouldn’t then be acceptable for me to intentionally harm you. It doesn’t matter what experience of pain you have only that you are capable of having a feeling that you don’t want to have. The same applies to animals, the fact that they can experience pain means that they have a preference to avoid it and by default, it is our moral obligation to ensure no unnecessary pain is caused to any living creature.",

            "The food chains within nature are incredibly important, they symbolise something that is part of the natural order and exists within an eco-system. They help to maintain healthy populations of animals and ensure that the natural ecology is balanced. What we do to animals when we selectively breed, artificially inseminate, mutilate and farm them, before driving them in trucks to the slaughterhouse where we hang them upside down, kill them and drain them of their blood is about as far removed from nature as possible and does not resemble anything like a food chain. The food chain that we have created for ourselves is a human construct to try and conveniently justify an entirely unnecessary act - it ignores the complexity and interdependent web of life that forms our ecosystems. It is an appeal to nature fallacy that overlooks our ability to make moral decisions and instead claims that our actions are predetermined for us entirely by biological determinism. It is a concept that we have conveniently constructed to assert and confirm our position as the dominant and most powerful species. It allows us to slaughter trillions of animals every year under the illusion and defence that it is a part of the natural world. We believe that because we have placed ourselves at the top of a hierarchical system we then have the right to exploit any we deem beneath us. Every human atrocity committed has come under the illusion of self-appointed power, whether it be Nazis believing they are superior to Jewish people, white people believing they are superior to black people, one religion believing they are superior to another religion or humans believing that they are superior to animals. The food chain excuse adopts the ‘might means right’ way of thinking, with people believing that because we have the physical ability to enslave and exploit others we are then morally justified to do so. But being in the position of power means that we have a responsibility to care for the vulnerable, we have a moral obligation to care and look after those weaker or less able than we are. The food chains in nature exist because they have to. The predator needs to kill the prey to survive. We don’t have to kill anyone to live, which means that we don’t have to use our dominance to kill others, we can use our power to look after others and create a better world - in fact, we have a moral obligation to. As humans we have moral agency, which means that we can make decisions based on a notion of right and wrong and most importantly we can be held accountable for the actions that we make. Our moral agency dictates to us that when we are in a situation where we have the choice to not inflict unnecessary suffering we can and should be held accountable if we actively choose to inflict unnecessary suffering instead.",

            "As a species we pride ourselves on our intelligence and we have achieved some truly incredible things, but unfortunately the idea that intelligence defines worth of life can often become one of the main driving forces as to why we justify raising and killing animals. Straight away this idea creates a whole host of problems, for starters pigs have been shown to be more intelligent than dogs and in fact have the same cognitive abilities as a three year old human, so surely we should be eating dogs, not pigs? Moreover, the animals that we eat, the cows, sheep, chickens, etc are vastly more conventionally intelligent than many other animals that exist with us on this planet, so if we did eat animals according to their intelligence we would instead be living off of insects. But if you think about it, if we eat specific foods according to their intelligence then we should be eating the least intelligent species, which are actually plants. Plants are the least intelligent species that exist as they lack the cognitive abilities that animals have, meaning that if we truly believe in the intelligence defines worth of life excuse then we should all be vegan anyway. I used the phrase “conventionally intelligent” earlier because one of the other issues with this excuse is that intelligence is largely subjective, as Einstein famously said, “If you judge a fish on their ability to climb a tree they will spend their whole life believing that they are stupid.”. But when you think about it, what exactly does intelligence have to do with worth of life? Why would someone who is more intelligent be more deserving of life? It doesn’t make any sense. As a species most of us are very quick to take credit for work that others have done, people say “but other animals have never built spaceships and been to space” - to which I ask “have you ever built a spaceship and been to space?”. Or people say “but we have written symphonies” - to which I ask “have you ever written a symphony?”. When someone brings up the intelligence argument, ask them: “Does intelligence define worth of life?” “Is your life worth more than someone who has learning difficulties?” “If intelligence equals dominance does that mean that anyone with a high IQ can do what they want to someone with a lower IQ?” “A pig has been shown to be more intelligent than a dog, does this fact mean that you will stop eating pigs and start eating dogs instead?” I think it also has to be said that for all of our intelligence and technological advancements, we arguably do the least intelligent things of any species. We are the only species that is destroying our planet, the only home that we have. We mindlessly consume without looking at the impact our actions are having. We are destroying the rainforests and the ocean at a frightening rate and we are polluting so much that our world is literally being destroyed in front of us and yet so little is being done to safeguard the future of even our own species. If you look at our actions, they certainly do not represent the actions of an intelligent species.",

        description:
            "When it comes to livestock animals people seem to use the excuse, “if it wasn’t for us these animals would never have been given a life, they should be grateful.” - let’s start by applying this logic to humans. If a child is born into an abusive family, where he or she is regularly beaten, is never fed and eventually dies from all the abuse, would we think “well at least that child’s parents gave them a chance to experience life?” Or, how about a Syrian child who has only ever known violence and fear. He sees his family killed by war and in an attempt to escape from the literal hell of his existence joins other refugees in making the dangerous journey into Europe by boat. But the boat sinks in the ocean and the child, scared and confused as to why such a horrible existence had been given to him, drowns. Should that child be grateful for the fact that they had the chance to exist? Would we be grateful? What about a woman who is born into human trafficking and spends her whole life being prostituted, should she be grateful to her captors? What about non-human animals? If I breed dogs into existence and then I mutilate, abuse and kill them, am I a good person for giving those dogs an experience of life in the first place? If I breed cats and then lock them in metal boxes that they can’t escape from, never allow them to go outside or breathe fresh air and then hang them upside down and cut their throats, am I now a morally righteous person, because without me those cats would never have been alive? Ask the people you are talking to those questions. Put the animals that we love in the position of the animals that we eat and ask whether we are still good people for giving them an experience of life. I find this excuse to be an incredibly arrogant one as it’s an excuse that only the oppressor could ever use. It’s an excuse that only someone who is living a comfortable life could use, because nobody who has experienced genuine suffering would ever claim that someone should be grateful for a life of pain. The simplest and most obvious way of deducing whether this is a good argument is to tap into our empathy. To really understand whether the so called ‘life’ we are giving to these animals is such a favour we need only put ourselves in their position. Put it this way, you’re given the opportunity to exist, but in return you will be taken away from your mother, be forcibly impregnated repeatably and each time you give birth you will have your children taken away from you. You will be in unrelenting pain, get excruciating infections and be abused by the people that hold you captive. When you are finally too weak to carry on, you collapse before being dragged to your own death, where you are hung upside down, have your throat slit and bleed to death. Would you accept that life? Would you be grateful and say “thank you, how kind. If it wasn’t for you I would never be given this wonderful opportunity!”. This excuse is used as if the animals that we raise to exploit, abuse and slaughter should be grateful, as if we are some benevolent, selfless species that deserves praise for all of our good deeds. Do you think that a pig whose entire life is spent in confinement, with huge periods of time trapped inside a farrowing crate too small for her to even move or turn around in, should be grateful? Would you be grateful, watching your children being taken away from you and mutilated in front of you? What about being castrated and having your body parts chopped off, now do you feel indebted to the oppressors that created you? These are all questions you can put to non-vegans when they state that animals should be grateful for being brought into this world by humans. The life that we give to these animals can barely even be called a life, in the eyes of these animals, they are in hell. They have nothing to feel grateful for. We do the most evil and unimaginably horrific things to these innocent creatures. We treat them as objects that we have dominion over, we inflict unspeakable violence onto them and yet we still have the audacity to say that they should be grateful to us for the life that we give them. The egg-laying hen kept in a cage should be grateful. The calf murdered for dairy should be grateful. The coyote killed for fur should be grateful. The pig killed in a gas chamber should be grateful. The cow that has a knife against their throat should be grateful. The fish dragged out of the ocean should be grateful. The animals tested on in laboratories should be grateful. The only time any of these animals feel a sense of gratitude is when their life is over and the pain and suffering inflicted upon them is over. The only gratitude these animals will ever feel is knowing that they’ll never again have to look into the eyes of the species that thinks it’s okay to treat them as commodities. Ask the person who uses this excuse, “do you think you could go to a slaughterhouse look an animal in they eye as they are about to be killed and tell them that they should be thanking you for their life?”",

        description:
            "Most consumers of animal products declare that they care about the wellbeing of animals and even go so far as to agree that the way we raise and kill animals is cruel. This is partly why many people choose to pay extra for free-range eggs and organic animal products. I was the same before I was vegan, I would always buy free-range eggs as I believed that the hens had lived a happy and fulfilled life. In fact, if people tell you that they buy free-range, or choose to buy animal products that are labelled as being high welfare, this can actually be a point that can be used in our favour, as it shows the person does have compassion for animals on some level. But let’s see, does the ‘humane’, ‘high-welfare’, ‘RSPCA-Assured’, ‘local’, ‘organic’ excuse morally justify exploiting and killing an animal? Well, taking an egg-laying hen out of a cage and into an overcrowded barn is about as helpful to the chicken as giving a prisoner a pillow to put his head on whilst he’s being waterboarded and labelling him as a ‘humanely tortured prisoner’. Jeffrey Dahmer was a serial killer who drugged his victims before he killed them, so in reality the people he killed weren’t aware they were going to die, they didn’t suffer and they didn’t feel pain (where have we heard those phrases before?) - does that mean he was a humane serial killer? Was he a high-welfare, ethical murderer? The reality is, it doesn’t matter what privilege or treatment the animals receive, if they are destined to be killed, exploited or abused in anyway then there is no ethical or humane way in which to treat these animals. The only humane method of slaughter is to not slaughter. The only happy chickens are the chickens that get to live a free life, truly free, not free-range. Humane slaughter is an oxymoron, as is high welfare murder, or happy exploitation. Now there is of course an argument that improving treatment for animals is better than keeping it the way it is, in the same way that taking paracetamol for a broken arm is better than not taking anything, but it’s not going to make the problem go away and it certainly doesn’t provide any real relief. In fact, what these welfare changes actually do is ease the conscience of the consumer, which is very dangerous as not only does it reinforce the idea that there is an ethical way to exploit an animal but it allows the consumer to buy a product and think that in doing so they are giving an animal a happy life. This is why it’s so important we don’t perpetuate these notions of welfare because to do so is an injustice to the animal who is still suffering. It’s important that when we are talking to non-vegans we have clear message that states “there is no right way to do the wrong thing” and if someone mentions free-range eggs or something similar, say something a long the lines of, “buying free-range eggs shows you care about animals, however did you know that free-range is sadly a marketing ploy as the animals are raised in huge barns where the vast majority are denied access to fresh air and sunlight - and the male chicks are still ground up alive and ultimately all of the hens still end up being slaughtered?”. Free-range is a deceitful attempt by the egg industry to lure customers into believing their product is more ethical and morally righteous than caged eggs and in doing so they can charge more money for the product. High welfare is a scam to make people think that the animal lived a happy, good life but as we all know, it doesn’t matter what label is on the product, the animal died in the same slaughterhouse using the same method as all the other animals on the shelves. In fact ask the person you are talking to about this, say “are the animals raised on small local farms taken to different slaughterhouses, or are they killed in the same way factory farmed animals are?”. The issue is, it doesn’t matter how nice a life an animal has, the moment we exploit them for what is rightfully theirs and eventually take them to the slaughterhouse or to the yard to kill them, that is abuse. Animals don’t want bigger cages or larger barns, they don’t care whether or not they’re grass-fed, or organic. They don’t want to be RSPCA-Assured or Red Tractor Approved, because those labels are there for us, the consumer, to ease our conscience. All the animals want is to be free, truly free. Not free-range, not free to pasture 4 - 6 months of the year. Free to live their lives in their entirety, without fear of human inflicted pain, suffering or exploitation. It always strikes me as strange that when people campaign against eating dogs in Yulin, they don’t campaign for the animals to be kept in bigger cages, or to be free- range. Nobody ever asks for the dogs to be killed in a more humane way. We demand that the festival be abolished. If it was RSPCA-Assured labrador steaks would that be acceptable? What about Red Tractor approved minced poodle? The purposefully misleading marketing terminology printed on animal products holds no veracity compared to the actual treatment of the animal who was exploited, murdered and packaged up neatly for consumers to eat free of any guilt or culpability. I think it’s really important to highlight these points to any non-vegan who says we should improve conditions or states that they buy animal products from happy farms or humane slaughterhouses. You could always ask the person you are talking to, “can we humanely kill an animal?” - this is actually one of my favourite questions. If the person believes there is a humane way to kill an animal, remind them that the word humane means “having or showing compassion or benevolence”, so re-phrase the question and ask, “how do we compassionately, benevolently or humanely take the life of an animal that does not want to die for an unnecessary reason?”. So now let’s consider improving the welfare of animals from an economic perspective. The monetary system that we have in place, capitalism, ensures that we exist in a system that values profits and economic gain. Do we really believe that a system that teaches people that it’s acceptable to exploit other humans and indeed our environment for their own gain is going to invest potential profits into securing high- welfare standards for animals? If humans are treated as a commodity by the corporations and big businesses then how can we plausibly allow ourselves to be brainwashed into believing that animals will be treated with respect and decency? But as we’ve already established, if we’re using an animal for our own gain, we are by default not treating them with respect and decency. So if the corporations aren’t going to invest their money into improving welfare standards that would mean that the price of animal products would have to rise and the consumer would have to pay extra. Most people simply aren’t able to pay extra for their food and many won’t when they don’t have to. Furthermore, if we did move towards a system of “idyllic” family farming, with grass-fed free-range animals, it would just simply not be environmentally sustainable to meet the world’s demand for animal products. There is simply not enough space on the surface of the planet. What this would also mean is that animal products would only become available for the rich and wealthy, making it a luxury and highly sought after product. This is one of the reasons why I really frown upon organisations like Compassion in World Farming, as their end goal not only still means animals are suffering but it is inherently classist, as it creates a world where the rich and wealthy are able to buy products that most of society can’t - and it takes us back to the days where eating animals was a sign of financial dominance. So to conclude, even if we did somehow improve the standards of welfare for factory farmed animals, whatever kind of paradox that may be, that would still not justify continuing to consume animal products.",

            "If I’m being honest, I don’t think I’d ever heard the phrasing “but morality is subjective” before I went vegan - and now it’s something I hear quite a lot and yet every time I hear it I always feel slightly astonished. If morality truly was subjective then there would be absolutely no need for a judicial system or prisons, there would be no such thing as good or bad as all behaviour would be completely acceptable. This is really how you can argue against the “morality is subjective” argument, by simply stating that if it was true then murder, rape, arson, theft, etc would by default all be completely moral and acceptable. Ask the person you are talking to, “if you believe morality is subjective, would it therefore be acceptable for someone to murder their partner?”. You could also ask, “using the morality is subjective argument, is it then acceptable for me to beat and kill a dog?”. If you wanted to you could even ask, “if you believe that morality is subjective then would it be justifiable for someone to murder you?”. I think one of the main arguments for why morality is subjective is because animals don’t live under any apparent set moral code, but this is not entirely true, animals do adopt a system of ethical conduct. Many animals display embarrassment, sorrow and regret. These emotions can only be exhibited if the animal understands that their behaviour was wrong in the first place. If no moral code existed then no animal, including humans, would feel regret or guilt, because we would never understand that what we had done was wrong. Unnecessary murder is immoral, we don’t need religion or science to know that. Abusing someone is immoral. Causing intentional pain or suffering to anyone for no necessary reason is immoral. We know these things because within us all exists an understanding of what is right and wrong, we can become blinded by conditioning but all we have to do is put ourselves in the position of the victim to understand why the action of hurting another cannot be morally justified. What morality really comes down to is the awareness of a victim. What is moral should be defined by whether or not what is being done has a victim that is suffering unnecessarily. I believe morality is as simple as “Would I want that done to me? And if not, what right do I have to do it to another?”. H. L Mencken stated: “morality is doing what’s right regardless of what you’re told. Obedience is doing what is told regardless of what is right.”",
