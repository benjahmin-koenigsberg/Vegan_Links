            "I’m tying in the “everything in moderation” argument with the idea of Meatless Mondays as both support the idea that reducing animal product consumption makes it both healthy and ethical. Let’s start with the health argument, when people say “everything in moderation”, or “a little bit of cheese or meat is healthy”, I normally respond by saying, “If something is bad for you, it’s bad for you. It doesn’t matter if you consume a lot or a little, it’s still bad for you. Now, you could smoke one cigarette a month and it wouldn’t give you cancer or kill you but that cigarette is still bad for you. Likewise, you could eat a slice of bacon once a month and although it wouldn’t kill you, it is still inherently bad for you.”. You could then go on to say, “the great thing about plants is they contain all the good nutrients and vitamins associated with animal products but they don’t come with all the incredibly unhealthy aspects like cholesterol, trans fat, hormones, antibiotics, etc.”. Now let’s turn our attention to the ethical implications of this argument. Veganism is the only social justice movement where people try and incorporate the idea of moderation or reducing as a viable solution. We would never consider it acceptable for a racist to simply reduce how much they were racist, or for a misogynist to simply reduce how often they oppress women. The reality is, it doesn’t matter how much or how little someone does these things, there is still a victim who is being impacted. This is why it is not morally justifiable to only reduce the amount of animal products we consume, as even if it is ‘only’ once a week there is still a victim who is being negatively impacted for an unnecessary reason, this is precisely why moderation or reduction is not an ethical compromise, because it means nothing to the animal who is still being exploited and killed. Claiming that eating flesh or animal products in moderation is ethically responsible validates the idea that using animals is normal and morally admissible. Let’s put this into perspective, most people who claim “everything in moderation” normally have a diet that consists of cow’s milk on their cereal and morning coffee, followed by a ham and cheese sandwich or something along those lines for lunch and probably another coffee with cow’s milk during the day. For dinner it will be cow flesh, or chicken flesh, or pig flesh, maybe some roast potatoes cooked in an animal’s fat. Afterwards it could be a dairy desert and then not to mention the snacks and biscuits that have dairy butter in them or the chocolate bars that have even more cow’s milk in. This diet resembles anything but moderation but this is the sort of diet that the majority of people in the UK consume on a daily basis. To bring this discussion back to the ethical side of the moderation argument, animals are still being murdered for no justifiable reason. No animal that gets murdered is grateful because the person that eats their flesh believes they do so in moderation. The animal is still dead, their life is still over and no amount of moderation or reduction changes that fact. If you are having a conversation with someone and they try to morally justify eating animal products by saying they do so in moderation or claim that they have reduced their consumption, ask them why. If they mention that it’s for ethical or environmental reasons then I think it’s important to praise them for reducing their consumption but at the same time don’t enable it and make sure to highlight how morally that still isn’t acceptable or good enough. Say something like “it’s great that you have reduced your animal product consumption for ethical reasons, but have you thought about how even though you may not be consuming as much as you used to, you are still paying for animals to be exploited and ultimately slaughtered?”.",

        description:
            "I think of all the excuses used against veganism this is actually a very important one and something that as vegans we need to be aware of. It is absolutely true that it is almost impossible to be 100% vegan in this world - for example the production and harvesting of crops does cause the death of animals like aphids, caterpillars, moths, worms, flies, locusts - and even birds, mice and rats. Where this argument falls apart is that it is used to suggest that if you can’t be 100% vegan there’s no point in trying at all, or more to the point because animals sometimes die in crop production it is therefore acceptable for us to breed, raise and kill animals intentionally. By this argument a fireman could be at a burning building about to go in and save a baby but then he realises that there’s also another person in there that he can’t save. So he decides that since he cannot save both, there is no point in saving either of them and leaves the baby to burn to death. Or a coastguard sees a group of drowning children but realises that it won’t be possible to save all of them, so he allows them all to drown instead of trying to save any of them. It’s like me saying, “well I can never be a truly 100% morally just person, so why bother trying to be a good person in the slightest?”. Or, “well I’m not a kind person all the time so why bother being kind at all?”. What this argument really boils down to is intention. When we buy animal products we are intentionally paying for someone to exploit and kill an animal, when we buy plants we are not. If an animal dies in the production of plants that is unintentional and as we can all agree, entirely regrettable. If someone was driving their car and they accidentally hit a dog, that would not be the same as if they purposefully drove after the dog until they ran them over. The logic behind the argument “it’s morally justifiable for me to pay for an animal to be killed because animals sometimes die in crop production” is stating that morally, accidentally hitting the dog is the same as purposefully hitting the dog, as it ignores the intention. It also states that because animals are sometimes killed accidentally by cars, it is therefore acceptable to purposefully run them over. When talking to a non-vegan who uses this excuse, ask them “morally, is there a difference between accidentally hitting a dog with your car and purposefully hitting a dog with your car?”. When they say yes, then ask them “so by that logic is there morally a difference between an animal accidentally being killed in crop production and an animal purposefully being killed in a slaughterhouse?”. Also, make sure to remember that vastly more plants are used in the production of animal products than they are vegan products, so be sure to say “if you care about the animals that are killed in crop production you should be vegan because vastly more plants are needed to create animal products, which means vastly more animals are killed in crop production for non-vegans than they are for vegans.”. This excuse also misses one of the biggest points of veganism, which is that we don’t need to eat animals or their secretions to live, hence why we don’t. The reason that insects and small animals die in crop production is not because we all want to eat them but because we do need to eat plants in order to sustain a healthy life. Ultimately, veganism is about minimising the damage done to animals as much as is possible and practicable, it’s not about being perfect. I think non-vegans often try and paint veganism as a pursuit for perfection as it makes it seem completely unobtainable, idealistic and not grounded in reality.",

        description:
            "The desert island excuse is without doubt a firm favourite for many non-vegans and I hear that due to the booming number of vegans winding up on desert islands there’s actually now a really successful falafel and hummus pop up. The idea of this excuse is that it seeks to create the illusion of hypocrisy in veganism. Non-vegans that use this excuse want to come to the conclusion that in a life or death situation, even a vegan would value his or her own life above that of an animal’s and therefore it is morally justifiable for them to continuing consuming animal products. Obviously, if someone was stranded on a desert island, vegan or not, they would seek to find fruits and vegetables first and if there were animals roaming around that we could kill, there would also presumably be vegetation that we could eat as well. Let’s be honest, if anyone did just randomly get stranded on a desert island their chance of survival would be incredibly low. Even if there was an animal there, most of us wouldn’t know how to kill them, butcher them and cook them, for this reason I would become friends with the animal. At least that way I would have a friendship and someone to spend time with as I slowly died from starvation and lack of clean drinking water. On a serious note, nobody can really judge what they’d do in a survival situation and there have been documented cases where humans have eaten each other in order to survive. The most important thing here however, is that just because humans have killed and eaten other humans for survival, doesn’t mean it is moral for us to kill and eat each other in a normal environment. This is really the main point of the rebuttal, because even if someone was forced to kill and eat an animal in a life or death situation, this provides no moral justification for eating animal products in everyday life. The reality is, we are not stuck on a desert island and therefore we do not need to kill and eat an animal out of necessity. We do however, live in a society where we are surrounded by an abundance of vegan foods, so morally this argument proves nothing. By creating an environment or a situation where every choice or possibility is an unsavoury one, non-vegans are trying to find solace for the fact their diet causes unnecessary and unjustifiable suffering to another living being. The desert island excuse is a way of reaffirming the myth that we need to eat animals to survive by creating an extreme situation with no satisfactory moral choices, and then transposing the conduct that one would find acceptable to commit on a desert island into everyday society. In essence it comes down to this, none of us are stranded on a desert island so the excuse is redundant and there is no moral correlation between killing an animal out of necessity in a life or death situation and killing an animal for nothing other than greed and selfish desire. The real question and the question you should ask the non-vegan you are in conversation with is, “why would you allow the destruction of our planet to continue, the needless slaughter of innocent animals to continue, the death of starving children to continue and the deterioration of your own health to continue when it is entirely unnecessary?” .",

        description:
            "When I was a vegetarian I was actually guilty of thinking this for a time before I turned vegan, I thought I had cut out supporting the murder of animals from my diet and that I didn’t need to go to vegan. The problem with this excuse is that even though most vegetarians cut out animal flesh for ethical reasons they are still hugely unaware of the atrocities committed to animals and don’t know the full extent of the ways that we exploit animals, I know that I certainly wasn’t aware. I became a vegetarian believing that animals shouldn’t die for food but I came to this conclusion without researching anything into the slaughter or treatment of animals. I hadn’t watched any slaughterhouse footage and I didn’t feel the need to because in my eyes I was no longer contributing to those systems of violence. I, like many others, was under the illusion that free-range eggs were ethical and that the treatment of dairy cows was humane. I never considered that female cows needed to give birth to produce milk, which really shows the power of the dairy industry and the propaganda that they feed to us. I remember even thinking that it isn’t necessary to become a vegan. I was very wrong. By being a vegetarian we still contribute to the needless torture, abuse and slaughter of animals. Being vegetarian quite simply isn’t enough, especially if the person believes that they are an ethical person. In the egg industry male chicks are a useless byproduct and they serve no use to the industry. So as soon as they are hatched they are thrown by the thousands into industrial grinders where they are minced apart, or they are gassed alive. These are new born babies and their first and only experience of life is being killed. Think of the confusion and fear these chicks feel as they are callously mistreated, thrown onto a conveyor belt and dropped into a grinder or into a machine designed to gas them to death. It’s so important to emphasise that all male chicks are killed regardless of what system of egg production it is. This happens in caged, free-range and organic facilities. Tell people that if they eat eggs they are by default paying for the murder of baby chicks. You can do this by saying something like, “what do you think happens to the male chicks in the egg industry, bear in mind that they are of a different breed to chickens raised for meat and are not suitable to be reared for their flesh?”. Furthermore, if people bring up free-range eggs, ask them “do you know what a free range egg farm looks like?”. You could even go so far as to ask, “do you not think free range could be a marketing ploy to make you buy a product with an eased conscience?”. Remember, free-range eggs still come at the use and abuse of hens. They still often have their beaks trimmed and even though legally they have to have access to the outdoors, many never leave the barn and are unable to access sunlight or fresh air in their entire lives. Even in free-range barns, hens only have on average the space of an iPad each and are crammed together, forced to stand on top of one another. In fact, farmers can legally house 16,000 birds per barn in the UK, which means they can legally house 9 birds per square metre of space. Many hens can’t cope with the stress of being genetically modified to produce 300 eggs per year instead of the 10 - 20 they would naturally, leading to them becoming malnourished and sick with diseases such as osteoporosis. In fact it is reported that more than 45% of egg laying hens break a bone at some point during their lives (http://www.landofhopeandglory.org/facts). Cannibalism is also a big problem on egg farms, with ill and dead birds being pecked at by their fellow birds. After the hens are spent, normally after 72 weeks, they are thrown into crates and are driven to a slaughterhouse, where they are then hung upside down and their throats are slit. Some hens survive this ordeal and are submerged in boiling hot water still alive and are boiled to death. The dairy industry is equally disgusting, like male chicks, newborn male calves are useless to dairy farmers and so they are taken away from their mothers normally within 24 - 72 hours of birth, some are even shot, killed and discarded immediately. The ones that are not shot will either be raised for veal, or they’ll be sold into the beef industry and raised for their flesh. The male calves that are slaughtered for veal are hung upside down and have their throats slit when they are still babies, the veal industry would not exist if it wasn’t for the dairy industry. Furthermore, like humans, cows only produce milk when they have given birth so female cows are forcibly impregnated using a process called artificial insemination in order to make them pregnant. If the calf is female she will also be taken from her mother only a few hours after being born. When people mention dairy I always like to ask, “why do you think a cow produces milk?” - as so many people I speak to simply don’t know why. You can also ask people, “what do you think happens to the calves if we’re drinking the milk that’s made for them?”. Or, “what do you think happens to the male calves in the dairy industry as they don’t produce any milk?”. Dairy cows have also been selectively bred to produce up to 10 times more milk than they would naturally. This overuse of their udders leads to painful infections such as mastitis, which can also cause pus and blood to be filtered into the milk that humans then drink. When they become too weak, or are unable to bear anymore children or produce anymore milk, they are taken to the slaughterhouse, where their throats are slit and they are left to bleed to death so that their flesh can be used for cheap meat products. Trapped in a hellish cycle of forced impregnation and forced lactation, repeatedly abused and exploited by the farmers, dairy cows, who in nature can live up to 25 years, die normally after only 4 to 5. For me this is one of the easiest ways to convince an ethical vegetarian, just explain to them that all the animals in the egg and dairy industries end up in the slaughterhouse. You should also explain the suffering animals endure in the clothing, entertainment and cosmetic industries, as vegetarians often support these systems too (I was a vegetarian that wore leather and went to the zoo). With dairy I always like to ask things along the lines of, “don’t you think it’s strange that we drink the milk from another species of animal, whose milk is actually meant for their babies and not for us?”. Or, “would you ever suckle on the udders of a cow yourself?”. Or, “would you ever drink pig milk, or rat milk?”. Now obviously being vegetarian still contributes massively to the suffering of animals, but many vegetarians are simply not aware of this, so any conversation with a vegetarian is a great opportunity for spreading veganism.",

        description:
            "Of all the excuses that meat eaters use to invalidate veganism this one is possibly the most unusual. I’ve grouped the ‘but Hitler was a vegetarian’ excuse with the ‘I once knew a vegan who wasn’t very nice’ because they both revolve around dismissing an entire movement and philosophy of life based on the actions of an individual. First and foremost, Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian, I believe some of these ideas came about because Goebbels wanted to make Hitler seem likeable by creating comparisons between him and Gandhi, who was a vegetarian. But that fact is neither here nor there when addressing the question because even if Hitler was a vegetarian, what exactly would that prove? The idea behind this argument is that because one of the most evil men in history, who committed vile atrocities, cared about animals, then by being vegan you too will probably undervalue humans as a consequence of your views towards animals. Quite obviously this excuse is beyond absurd. Chairman Mao, Mussolini and Stalin all ate meat and committed unforgivable crimes. So by the logic of the ‘but Hitler argument’, vegans could say you better become vegan because Stalin ate animals and if you eat animals you'll be just like Stalin. If you are ever in a situation where someone actually uses this argument genuinely, I would first suggest that you take a moment to pause and take a deep breath, then say “actually Hitler wasn’t a vegetarian, but even if he was how does that morally justify you eating animals and their secretions?”. You could also remind them that you are vegan, not vegetarian - and that you oppose the philosophy of vegetarianism as it perpetuates the needless slaughter of both dairy cows, male chicks and egg-laying hens. If you think about it, fascists believe that they are superior to others based on entirely superfluous notions of heritage, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. Likewise, people eat animals for entirely superfluous notions as well. Now, obviously non-vegans aren’t necessarily fascists but if there are comparisons being made, slaughtering trillions of animals for an entirely unnecessary and immoral reason is much more in line with the behaviour of the Nazis than eating plants and advocating for all life to be treated with respect and compassion is. Needless to say, I would not recommend insinuating that the person you are talking to is in anyway a Nazi or a fascist! But nonetheless, the Hitler excuse seeks to set up an association between not eating animals and being evil, which can be a dangerous comparison to draw if someone was to believe that Hitler was actually a vegetarian. But to any rational minded individual, it is quite clearly a ridiculous argument as it could be just as easily argued by this logic that because Hitler brushed his teeth or used a car anyone who does either of those things is by default a psychopath. I think the real issue with this excuse is that it attempts to demonise the vegan movement by associating it with the complete opposite of what it really stands for and for this reason I find this excuse more than just the outlandish argument it first seems. So let’s take this excuse and focus on the next element of it, which is “but I once knew a vegan who wasn’t very nice to me”. This argument follows the same idea that because someone who was vegan wasn’t very nice, they therefore invalidate the entire movement and everyone who is a part of it. Now for obvious reasons this logic is very flawed. For instance, I was once shouted at by a ticket inspector on a train in Hungary because there was a misunderstanding surrounding my ticket. Does that now mean I am morally justified to believe that all Hungarian men are not very nice? Or does that mean every ticket inspector on every train isn’t very nice? I once had an altercation with a lady in New York who told me she hated British people, I must now be morally justified to not like all New Yorkers, or even all women? The reality is, we have all had bad experiences with people at some point in our life, but to then believe that you can look down upon or judge on an entire demographic of people based on that one experience is obviously not logical in the slightest. Say that to the person you are talking to - “do you think it is sensible to judge an entire demographic of people based on the actions of one individual?”.",

        description:
            "So this is actually a slightly tricky argument, as it’s an important issue and one I imagine will be used more frequently as the vegan movement progresses. When someone brings up the issue of farmer’s livelihoods I normally say something like, “you’re absolutely right, we do need to consider the livelihoods of farmers, who are often born into the farming community and have never known anything different in their lives and have never questioned the morality of what they do.”. The reason I do this is because it makes us seem reasonable. Most people see farming as an idyllic, traditional job and we’re fed an idea of good, honest farmers struggling to make enough money to survive. Now this may not be strictly true, but it is what people believe and I think the most effective way of dealing with this is to acknowledge that farmer’s livelihoods are at risk and are therefore warranting of some consideration. When I first went vegan I had the mindset of “well I don’t recall anyone saying we shouldn’t close down Auschwitz because all those SS officers will lose their jobs, and they have families to feed” but it didn’t take too long for me to realise that this may not be the best outreach technique to use. The issue with farmers is that they are the ones directly enslaving, mutilating and profiting off the exploitation and death of animals and as such, it can be hard for us to want to address the issue of their livelihoods because the most important thing for us is to end the exploitation of animals as quickly as we possibly can. What we have to be considerate of though, is that these farmers are doing a job that they are being demanded to do, they are fulfilling the wishes of the consumer. Now, undeniably there are truly evil farmers who deserve no sympathy or consideration - I’ve spoken to other farmers who agree with this. The issue is most farmers are doing what they are told to do and operate under what is deemed legal, many were also born into farming families and consequently have been conditioned and indoctrinated into a certain way of life and genuinely believe that farming animals is completely ethical and moral. So as vegans we are left with a moral dilemma because we all readily acknowledge that the reason good people perpetuate systems of violence towards animals is because they have been conditioned to do so, but the same logic applies to farmers as well, who have also been conditioned into these same systems of violence. What this fundamentally means, is that farmers need to be given some form of consideration that shows they’re not entirely morally culpable for the life that they have been given and I think an awareness of the fact their jobs are at risk fulfils this need. One thing you can say to the person you are talking to is, “I agree that the issue surrounding the livelihoods of farmers is something that needs addressing but do you think that the life of animals and the planet is more important than money?”. For me this is really what it boils down to, money or life? Obviously, the life of an animal is far more important than money and most people will agree with that, but they need to be asked the questions in order to realise it. So I guess this leads us on to the discussion of what do we do about farmer’s jobs? There are a couple of things that can be done, firstly and most simply farmers can switch to arable farming and produce only plants. This is an entirely plausible solution for some farmers and in fact it has already been done by a number of farmers, including a cattle farmer who recently gave all of ‘his’ herd to Hillside Animal Sanctuary - and he now runs a fully vegan farm. The Vegan Society will offer help and financial support to any farmers who want to make the transition, so that’s always a really good thing to tell the person you are talking to. Another way of supplying the funds to farmers looking to make the transition is through tax subsidies. For me this is probably the most important thing that needs to happen to safeguard farmer’s livelihoods. So currently a proportion of our tax money is given to farmers to help financially support what they do, the issue is though, the majority of the subsidies go straight to dairy and animal farms, which is one of the reasons why animal products remain affordable. If the subsidies were removed it would cause huge problems to those industries. What needs to happen, is the subsidies that are given to animal farming need to instead be put into plant farming, this would drive the price of animal products up, making them less accessible and less affordable and bring the price of plants down, making them more accessible and more affordable. It would also mean that these subsidies could be used to help and financially support animal farmers transition over to plant farming instead. However, there will be farmers who can’t switch to producing plants as their land won’t be suitable for arable farming. This inherently means that they will probably end up losing their job as a farmer, but it was always going to be inevitable that would happen for some farmers. What is most important here is a sense of perspective, a job or a livelihood does not provide moral justification for enslaving, mutilating and profiting off the death of animals and in this situation the hardships of a farmer finding a new job is nothing compared to the life of suffering and fear that animals have to endure in the farming industries. What also strikes me as disingenuous, is for the most part people don’t ever normally care about whether or not their actions are jeopardising the jobs of others. For example, if you use the self-checkout machines in supermarkets you are jeopardising the jobs of the cashiers as their job becomes redundant. Another example that you could say to someone is “would you advocate for everyone to smoke cigarettes because if nobody smoked all the tobacco farmers and people employed within the cigarette industries would lose their jobs and their livelihoods?”. If they say no, you could follow up with “why do you think the job of an animal farmer is more important than the job of a tobacco farmer?”. Furthermore, not everybody is going to stop eating animal products overnight, the shift will be gradual, which means farmers wouldn’t be put out of jobs immediately and this would instead provide the perfect opportunity for them to phase into a different career. Also, when it comes to livelihoods and jobs, it’s only ever farmers that are mentioned, nobody ever expresses a concern for the jobs of slaughterhouse workers. In fact sometimes non-vegans say to me, “how could anyone ever do a job like that?”, or “you have to be a sick person to work in a slaughterhouse.” - that really irritates me as people who work in slaughterhouses generally do so out of necessity, not because they want to - and the only reason those jobs exist is because consumers buy animal products. Slaughterhouse workers are often immigrants or working class people who have little to no other options. They suffer from some of the highest rates of PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicide and drug and alcohol abuse in any profession and suffer huge psychological issues as a result of killing animals. Abolishing animal agriculture would be a liberation for these people as well as for the animals.",

        description:
            "This excuse is similar to the food chain argument in the sense that it operates under the belief that our consumption of animals is morally justified because it is part of some natural order and as such, we are merely fulfilling our responsibility as a species within the animal kingdom. Claiming that eating animals is the circle of life is a contradiction because animal agriculture is the circle of continuous unnecessary torture and death. Life is the exact opposite of what the animal agriculture industry is. The only two moments of life that are certain are our birth and our death and this is really all the circle of life actually refers to, everything that is born must indeed come full circle and die as well. What happens between these two events is variable and has nothing to do with a preordained circle of life. The concept of the circle of life is used by non-vegans who are trying to assert that humans are entitled to kill animals because of a pre-ordained natural order that is out of our control. They are essentially arguing that just because everything that lives must die, it therefore means we are morally justified to intentionally take life. This would theoretically mean then that we are justified to take any life that we want, in any manner that we choose because after all, it is the circle of life. I could needlessly murder a dog, I could needlessly murder a cat, or indeed, I could needlessly murder any animal for that matter. Using the logic behind the circle of life argument you would be morally excused for murdering a human as well. If someone you are talking to brings up the circle of life argument ask them, “by the logic that we are morally justified to slaughter animals because all life dies anyway, would it therefore be acceptable for me to cut the throat of a dog?”. It’s also interesting how the circle of life argument only applies to us killing non-human animals, it doesn’t also transpose to when humans kill other humans, or indeed to when non-human animals kill humans. When we hear about a shark or a crocodile killing a human we don’t sit back and say, “oh well, it’s the circle of life, what is born must one day die!”. No, we get angry and we send hunters or fishermen to try and kill the animal in an act of vengeance and because we fear that animal may go on to kill more people. If a human murders another human, we arrest them, punish them and send them to jail. However, if we are to subscribe to the logic of this excuse then murder would not be a crime or a punishable offence because death is inevitable and for that very reason it is acceptable to take the life of anyone we wish. If the needless murder of animals is justifiable because of the circle of life, then that means the needless murder of any animal is justifiable, not just the ones we conveniently want this logic to apply to. Furthermore, if the basis of the argument is grounded in what is perceived to be natural then that still provides no justification for how we raise, farm, exploit and kill animals as the systems that we have created couldn’t be further detached from nature. How can forcibly impregnating cows so that we can drink the milk that was designed to feed their children, be natural? It defies nature. How can raising animals in cages and then gassing them or anally electrocuting them so we can wear their skin be considered natural? How can putting cosmetics and toiletries into the eyes of animals and burning their skin with corrosive substances be morally justified through the idea of the circle of life? All of these things defy any notion of the circle of life, because the circle of life claims that what we are doing is intrinsically linked to nature but in reality, what we do couldn’t be further removed from the natural world. If we add to this the fact that 15 of our top 16 killers are caused by eating animal products it becomes apparent that it’s not only the circle of death for animals, but for us as well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ).",

            "I haven’t talked that much about the environmental aspects of veganism and I think it is pretty much unanimously agreed that a vegan diet is significantly better for the environment than a non-vegan diet. In fact, the United Nations stated not so long ago that to avoid the worst effects of climate change, everybody needs to shift to a plant- based diet immediately. However, one environmental argument that many people often cite is that soya farming has environmental consequences such as rainforest destruction and habitat loss. Now undoubtedly the environmental impact and destruction caused by soya is massive, but we need only consider that 85% of the soya that is grown is fed to livestock animals - and that’s a conservative estimate. This pretty much dispatches the argument immediately as we can sustainably produce enough soya for human consumption - the issue surrounding soya farming is that such vast quantities are produced to feed livestock animals, which is why it’s bad for the environment, not because vegans consume soya milk. If someone brings up the soya argument say, “you’re right, soya farming is destructive for the environment, but did you know that over 85% of the soya grown is fed to livestock animals? It’s because of animal agriculture that soya is currently so destructive.”. You could also go on to say, “as you are worried about the environmental impact of soya farming, do you think you will give up animal products now that you know they are the main reason for the destructive elements of soya farming?”. I think another important thing to mention is that the soya that is used in foods for humans isn’t just used in vegan favourites such as tofu. It’s found in cereals, processed foods, breads, sauces, mayonnaise, animal flesh products, chocolate, sweets. Basically soya is predominantly used in non-vegan foods. Furthermore, something a farmer said to me not so long ago was “well you can go and enjoy your gm-soya!”. Interestingly however, if you actually look, many vegan soya products are advertised as using non-gm soya, or at least the ones here in the UK are. The majority of the gm-soya is grown to feed livestock animals, so if someone ever tries to use that as an argument (although I doubt many people will), remember to tell them that. So it’s pretty obvious that if people are really concerned about the environmental destruction caused by soya farming then it would be hypocritical of them if they don’t become vegan. Lets also consider that 1 - 2 acres of rainforest is cleared every second for animal agriculture and that animal agriculture, including livestock and their byproducts are responsible for up to 51% of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to just 13% for the whole transport system combined. Basically there is no such thing as an animal eating environmentalist or a vegetarian environmentalist for that matter. If you care about the environment then you have to be a vegan, it’s that simple. When talking to an environmentalist it’s so important to emphasise this information to them, as most environmentalists still aren’t vegan - but why is this? I think one of the main reasons is because people expect governments and corporations to be the ones leading the change when it comes to the environment and it becomes incredibly easy to point the finger at businesses that exploit the environment and blame them for all the issues we are currently facing, rather than looking at our own actions and assessing whether or not we are doing everything we can as individuals. I think when we talk to non-vegan environmentalists we need to empower them to understand that as individuals we have the power to make all the difference and we can’t expect politicians and CEOs to implement real change. We need to tell them that it’s up to us the consumer to lead the change and even though absolutely our governments need to switch to renewable energy and stop taking handouts from oil and natural gas lobbyists, it’s hypocritical of us to demand change if we aren’t willing to make simple changes ourselves.",

            "Vegan diets have become somewhat synonymous with the idea of restrictive eating, people view vegan food as limiting and there is also a misconception that vegan diets are expensive and elitist. Let’s start with the idea that veganism is a restrictive diet. Since becoming vegan I eat a much larger and more varied range of foods than I ever did before and I’m cooking with ingredients I’d never heard of. Becoming vegan encouraged me to broaden what I eat and if anything I now view being non-vegan as restrictive. You can also point out to the person you are talking to that you still eat the same meals that you used to. You still have pizza, spaghetti bolognese, mac and cheese, curries, nachos, burritos, etc in fact you can veganise pretty much any non-vegan meal. So there’s no way that veganism can be restrictive because you can still eat the same foods that you used to, the only difference being they are now made from plants. So a vegan diet is anything but limiting and for that matter it is anything but extreme. This word extreme is often used to describe vegans but the irony is for the first time my lifestyle is the opposite of extreme. No longer do I eat death, no longer does my food come from animals that screamed in pain as they were murdered. No longer am I eating foods that are the product of enslavement and torture. Those things sound extreme. Not fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, legumes, nuts, potatoes, etc - foods that grow naturally and that don’t scream in agony. How can a vegan diet be extreme, when it consists of eating foods that prevent and cure disease, foods that increase the longevity of our lives, foods that give us more energy and help us to live more harmoniously with animals? Non-vegans eat products that give them an abundance of illnesses and diseases such as cancer and heart disease, their foods come from buildings called slaughterhouses and are produced from animals that were mutilated and enslaved. Now that sounds extreme. So, how about “but vegan food is expensive and elitist”. If you go into any supermarket, the most expensive foods tend to be the flesh and cheese and the cheapest foods are the beans, rice, potatoes, pasta, lentils, etc. Since going vegan I actually spend less money on food than I used to, as the majority of my diet consists of ingredients like oats, starches, carbohydrates and vegetables, all of which are among the cheapest foods you can buy. The only time where vegan food can be more expensive is when buying the substitutes, for example, frozen vegan ‘chicken’ nuggets are still more expensive than non-vegan chicken nuggets, but this is to do with supply and demand. As more people go vegan and buy those products, the cheaper they will become. You can now get soya milk for the same price as cow’s milk and the vegan cheeses in supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Tesco are the same price if not cheaper than the cheese made from cow’s milk. You can also get vegan burgers and vegan mince for pretty much the same price, so even the substitutes are becoming more accessible and affordable all of the time. A vegan diet doesn’t mean you have to be eating expensive organic fruits or going to juice bars, the foundation of a good vegan diet is affordable and accessible foods, which are much cheaper than animal products. Plus when I used to handle flesh, I would hate it, it was slimy, smelly and I’d have to wash my hands and surfaces afterwards. Now when I handle fruits and vegetables I love it, they’re so colourful and vibrant, all you do is give them a rinse and they’re good to go, I don’t have to scrub my hands clean once I’ve chopped them. Now that I’m vegan I look forward to cooking, I used to view it as a chore but now it’s one of my favourite parts of the day. This brings us to the final point, as vegans we always get asked by non-vegans why we eat animal product substitutes if we don’t want to eat animal products. As much as I hate the thought of eating animal products now and it makes me feel sick and very uncomfortable, I, like most vegans, didn’t become vegan because I disliked the taste of animal products. Before I became vegan I loved KFC and cow flesh burgers, I loved halloumi and Domino’s pizzas - but I realised that there are more important things in life than my sensory pleasure. As a species we have to understand that justifying our actions by the fact that we find enjoyment in them is not acceptable if it negatively impacts the lives of others. Vegans eat animal product substitutes because we enjoy the texture and the flavour - and it’s even better because no animal had to die or be exploited for our enjoyment of them.",

            "This is without question an excuse that is used a lot to justify exploiting animals and it is one that we have to deal with on a regular basis. Interestingly, the way that I approach this excuse has actually changed a lot from when I first started advocating for veganism. There’s a lot of evidence that shows that we are actually not natural omnivores and are instead much more closely related to herbivores and frugivores - this was the argument that I would always make when discussing the omnivore excuse. The problem I found though, was that the conversation would often lose focus and become only about whether or not we are omnivores, rather than whether or not it is morally justifiable to kill animals. People are indoctrinated their whole life to believe that we are natural omnivores and this was something that I ardently believed for most of my life. I think often when people hear vegans say that we aren’t omnivores it makes them think that we are deluded and ignoring basic biology and then they struggle to see the arguments that we make as being credible. The reality is, it is entirely irrelevant if we are natural omnivores or not, it provides no moral justification for us to exploit animals as just because we can do something, does not mean that it is ethical for us to do it. If someone believes that we are an omnivore then by default that means that we are able to obtain energy and nutrients from plants and as such, we are able to sustain life from plants alone. Consequently, that means that there is no necessity for us to eat animals and because there is no necessity it cannot be morally justified. Ask the person, “if we are natural omnivores, which means that by default we can survive only on plants, how do we then morally justify taking the life of an animal as by your own admission it is unnecessary?”. The canine argument is definitely one of the most amusing justifications that people try and use but before I was a vegan I remember using the canine argument myself and truly believing that my canines made it acceptable for me to pay for someone else to kill an animal on my behalf. The quickest and easiest way of debunking this argument is to point out that a hippopotamus has the largest canines of any land animal and they are entirely herbivorous. Other herbivores with sizeable canine teeth include the gorilla, the saber- toothed deer and camels. Our canines are not capable of tearing raw flesh or killing animals and instead are there so that we can bite into hard, crunchy plants (like apples!). If someone you are talking to brings up the canine teeth argument, ask them, “hippos actually have the largest canine teeth of any land animal and they are entirely herbivorous, do you still think that canines grant you the right to pay someone to kill an animal for you?”. Also, just because we posses a physical ability that allow us to do something doesn’t make that action moral. So just because we can physically put animal products in our mouth and digest them does not therefore mean that it is an ethical thing to do. For example I can physically clench my fist but that doesn’t mean that I am morally justified to then punch someone. Ask the non-vegan using this excuse, “do you think that because we posses a physical attribute that allows us to do something, we are therefore morally justified to do it?”. If they say yes you could then ask, “I can physically clench my fist, does mean that I am morally justified to then punch someone?”. I think it’s also important to look at and know why there is an argument that we are not natural omnivores because it does sometimes come up and it is important to know. So the most important points that I use are that our teeth are flat and blunt and are capable of moving side to side, as a natural herbivores are. Our stomachs have weak hydrochloric acid in them, compared to natural meat eaters who have strong hydrochloric acid and the intestines of an omnivore are 3 times shorter than ours, which is important as animal products are devoid of fibre. Also, if we were naturally meant to kill animals we would be able to do so with ease, but the reality is, if we were given a pig that we had to kill using only our hands and teeth, at best we’d probably give the pig a tickle. But let’s say we did manage to kill the pig, how would we then butcher the pig and eat them? What about the organs, like the intestines and brains, the cartilage, the tendons and ligaments? As a natural animal eater we wouldn’t be picky about the bits of the animal that we ate, the whole animal would look appetising to us. Yet how many news articles or images have we seen where people are outraged because they found a chicken’s brain in the KFC they were eating? True animal eaters don’t find the body parts of the animals they are eating abject, they see the body parts as food - and aren’t repulsed by the gore.",

Scientists agree that most, if not all, vertebrates (as well as some invertebrates) are conscious and that a cerebral cortex as swollen as our own is not a prerequisite for a subjective experience of the world. The planet contains a multitude of brains, dense and spongy, globular and elongated, as small as poppy seeds and as large as watermelons; different animal lineages have independently conjured similar mental abilities from very different neural machines. A mind does not have to be human to suffer.",

            'In my experience religion is one of the hardest excuses to argue against because people believe they have been told by a God that they are allowed to eat animals. This unfortunately means it can be incredibly hard to convince someone who is religious because in their eyes they are merely following what they believe they are allowed to do. When we discuss veganism with someone who is religious I think we have to be cautious to keep the argument focussed and not make it about the religion itself but how the person’s religion doesn’t justify them killing animals. First and foremost, in no religious doctrine does a God say that we have to eat animals, he says we can if we need to but not that we have to. This means that religion still doesn’t provide a necessity for us to exploit animals and as such it still remains unnecessary and therefore impossible to morally justify. A question I like to ask people who mention religion is, “if we don’t have to kill God’s creatures do you not think a kind, compassionate, benevolent God would rather that we didn’t?”. I will often say, “when Jesus was alive there was not the abundance of foods that we have now and it is plausible that Jesus would have had to eat animals to survive. However, we have progressed so much as a society that there is no longer a necessity, so do you not think that in the eyes of an all loving God, he would prefer it if we didn’t kill his creatures if we don’t have to to survive?”. Part of my frustration with religion is that, unlike the consumption of animal products, it is a personal choice and as such when people use a belief to condemn an animal to a life of suffering and pain it does not come close to making that action moral. Using a religious belief to justify killing animals is exactly the same as using a religious belief to oppress homosexuals or women. In fact, if the logic “my religion says I can eat animals” makes eating animals moral, then by default the argument “my religion says it’s okay to treat homosexuals or women as less than me” must also make oppressing homosexuals and women moral. I also don’t think God would be happy with what we are doing to his creatures and the planet that he made for us. Could you imagine if you had a piece of wood and you thought “you know what, I’m going to make my friend a lovely table out of this, they would really like that.” For the sake of argument let’s pretend that you spent 6 days making it for your friend and on the 6th day you looked at all you had made and it was perfect. So you give your friend the table and they claim to be so appreciative, they say “thank you so much, you have given me this table and I will forever be grateful to you”, but then right in front of your eyes they take a sledgehammer and start destroying it. Would you be happy about that? Because this is what we are doing to God with the earth. We claim to be incredibly grateful for the planet and all of the life that he has created, yet we are destroying everything he made for us right in front of him. He created non-human animals and we say thank you to him everyday by driving them to extinction and killing them by the trillions. We have even genetically modified his creatures, in essence playing God ourselves, because the creatures he created for us weren’t suitable for what we wanted from them. Furthermore, we go against God’s wishes by taking the milk from mothers that he designed specifically for their children. In what reality would a God be happy that we forcibly impregnate his creatures and take their babies away from them just so that we can take something that he didn’t design for us in the first place? In what reality do we think that a God would be happy about us murdering his creatures when it serves absolutely no necessity? How can a God be pleased with us destroying the beautiful rainforests that he spent time creating just so we can produce more cattle that we then needlessly slaughter? Why would a God create such an intricate marine eco-system, where each species of fish is as important as any other, but then be happy to watch us destroy it right in front of him? In 50 years we have decimated shark, dolphin and whale populations and in the past 40 years we have wiped out 50% of all wildlife on this planet. Now one of the main issues with using religion as a justification for anything really, is that religious texts are often very ambiguous and of course open to interpretation, this is partly the reason why some Christians believe it is a sin to be gay, whereas others don’t. This same ambiguity can also be seen when turning to the Bible for moral guidance on whether or not we should eat animal products. One of the main passages that people use from the Bible to justify eating animals is “every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; I give all to you, as I gave the green planet.” - but this is often taken out of context as the passages goes on to read “only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood”. Furthermore, in Genesis the Bible states: "And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.”. Amos 6:4-7 states: “Woe to those who stretch themselves upon their couches and eat lambs from the flock and calves from the midst of the stall. They shall be the first to be exiled.”. Furthermore, Ecclesiastes 3:19 states: “For what happens to people also happens to animals—a single event happens to them: just as someone dies, so does the other. In fact, they all breathe the same way, so that a human being has no superiority over an animal.”. There are a multitude of passages from the Bible and indeed in the teachings of all the mainstream religions that further reinforce the idea that no religion mandates the consumption or exploitation of animals. Sometimes one of the simplest questions to ask someone who is using religion as an argument is to ask, “do slaughterhouses look like the work of Jesus or the Devil?”. Hell is described as a place of eternal suffering, torment and pain and yet all you have to do is watch slaughterhouse footage to see that they too are places of eternal suffering, torment and pain. For the animals, a slaughterhouse is hell and no benevolent God or prophet could ever condone what happens inside them. A question that I often ask to Christians is, “if Jesus and the Devil were locked in a room with a baby lamb, which one would kill the lamb?”.',
