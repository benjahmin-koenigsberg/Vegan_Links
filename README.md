## About The Project
####The Vegan Links App

![Vegab Links App Screenshot](/vegan_links.png "Vegab Links App Screenshot").

I was inspired by a public spreadsheet avaible online called the Vegan Cheat Sheet, an aggregated list of over 440 different vegan links. I wanted to build a with an alternate graphical user interface and additional features. The ultimate purpose of this app is to help vegan and non vegans refrence, discover and share vegan resources.

A few features:
* Over 440 vegan links organized by over 20 categories, inlcuding  'activism' , 'nutritional studies', 'movies',
* Search by category or keyword
* A 'Favorites' feature to save your favored links
* Easily share links with friends and family


### Built With

I used Mimo, an online web wireframing and design app to build the design layout. The app is built in React, using the useContext() hook for state management.


* React
* React Toastify
* Font Awesome
* Local storage
